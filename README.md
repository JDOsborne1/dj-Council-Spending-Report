# Data Journalism: Council Spending Report

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of dj-Council-Spending-Report is to investigate the data
provided by South Gloucestershire Council with the aim of generating a
report of any interesting features.

Additionally there is a report on the implementation gap of the
governments Open Data policy, and a discussion around the implications
of such a gap.

## Spending Report

In the spending report I aim to answer the following three questions:

1.  Who are the most significant recipients of council payments?
2.  Does the volume of outgoings change over time?
3.  Is the majority of the total outgoing value made up of small
    payments?

To this aim I make use of the payments over Â£500 data provided by the
South Gloucestershire Council

## Implementation Gap

The implementation Gap report is a side report which arose from the
difficulties which I initially faced when extracting the data for the
main spending report. It serves as a standalone piece of analysis on the
differences between public policy and the reality of the public data
realm. Additionally it serves to prevent such discussion from
overwhelming the message of the main Spending Report above
